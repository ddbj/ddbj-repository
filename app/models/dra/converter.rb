# raises Unmapped, as does text where the table takes none: the table is the
# spec's account of everything SRA XML can hold, so an item outside it is one
# the record would lose.

# the list's elements stand for (DRA::Mapping.anchor): its attributes, its
# text and its descendants write into the same element (`STUDY/@accession`
# and `STUDY/DESCRIPTOR/STUDY_TITLE` into one of `projects[]`), and a sibling
# XML element starts another. A row naming a list element itself
# (`SUBMISSION/ACTIONS/ACTION: submission.sra.actions[]`) starts one even if
# nothing is written into it.
